Hi, I'm Alex Braylan. I am a researcher, practitioner, and enthusiast of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, computer science, economics, etc since approximately 2007. I am pursuing a PhD in computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, where my [research focus is on crowdsourcing](http://ir.ischool.utexas.edu/). I am particularly interested in the problem of efficiently collecting high-quality, large, complex, human-annotated datasets for the sake of training machine learning models. Previously I received a MS in computer science, also at UT Austin, where I did [research on reinforcement learning and transfer learning](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?braylan) for video games. Currently I am also employed as principal machine learning scientist at [Revionics](https://www.revionics.com/), where I research and develop economic demand models for price optimization and forecasting. I am an advisor for an NLP startup [Macronometry](https://www.macronometry.com/insights), previously co-founded a crowdsourcing startup Nous (now defunct), and before that worked as a stock trader at Bank of America Merrill Lynch developing statistical arbitrage and other "quant" strategies. In case you're wondering why my Github handle is Praznat, that is the randomly-generated name of the guide from my random goblin society simulator, [Autonomous Goblin Paradise](https://github.com/Praznat/AGP).
