A transfer learning approach is presented to address the chal- lenge of training video game agents with limited data. The ap- proach decomposes games into objects, learns object models, and transfers models from known games to unfamiliar games to guide learning. Experiments show that the approach im- proves prediction accuracy over a comparable control, lead- ing to more efficient exploration. Training of game agents is thus accelerated by transferring object models from pre- viously learned games.
